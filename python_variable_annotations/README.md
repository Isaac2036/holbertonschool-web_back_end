<h1>Python - Variable Annotations</h1>
This repository contains examples and explanations of variable annotations in Python.

Variable annotations are a new feature in Python 3.5 and later, which allow you to specify the type of a variable at the time of its definition. This can be useful for documenting your code, improving code readability, and catching type errors at runtime.
